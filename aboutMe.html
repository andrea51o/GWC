<h1>Intro:</h1>
<p>I am extremely shy and I usually spend my time listening to music and looking at places I want to travel to. I'm Mexican, so my first language is Spanish. I volunteer at the Hayward public library and that's about all I do with my life. This is my first year attending Girls who Code.</p>
<p>I'm dress like a 12 year old, so I guess that's something everyone should know. I've spent most of my existance being a professional fangirl and wasting my life away obsessing over various things.</p>
<p>I have dedicated my entire life to school, so I'm not the most interesting person.</p>
<p>Another slightly less interesting fact about me is that I have 2 metal rods and 18 screws in my back. YAY scoliosis(Insert sarcasm)!</p>

<h1>Hobbies:</h1>
<P>Creating music, binge watching netflix, embroidery, going to concerts and sleeping. I also like to spend my time obsessing over boybands(as I have previously mentioned).</p>
<p>I love music so I'm always singing and playing my piano. I'm basiclly a grandma now because I actually enjoy embroidery and find it fun. </p>

<h1>Skills:</h1>
<p>I want to say that I have skills in photography, but I highly doubt it. I can binge watch an entire netflix series in about a day.</p>
<p>I also have the ability to make any situatuation instantly awkward.</p>

<h1>Favorite Foods:</h1>
<p>My favorite foods are anything that is Mexican, especially tamales. I also love watermelon, peaches and jelly beans.</p>
<p>I can't tolerate spice foods, but I love them. My parents have stripped me of my Mexican title because of this.</p>
